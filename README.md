Welcome to the world of Python!

In the beginning, Python projects tend to have a more "C-oriented" approach, focusing on simplicity without fancy syntax or clever tricks. However, if you're already familiar with Python, don't worry! Exciting and creative aspects of the language will come your way soon.

One of the beauties of Python, similar to many high-level languages, is that there are numerous ways to accomplish the same task. While some tasks may have a preferred or recommended implementation, others may offer multiple valid approaches.

In the realm of style and consistency, Python has its own linter and style guide akin to Betty in the C world. It's called PEP8, which is now also referred to as PyCode.

Enjoy your journey in the Python world!
