Inheritance allows a derived class to inherit attributes and behaviors from a base class. The syntax for defining a derived class is `class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName)`. When a derived class is created, the base class is remembered, and attribute references are resolved by searching in both the derived class and the base class.

Python supports single inheritance, where a derived class can inherit from a single base class. It also supports multiple inheritance, where a derived class can inherit from multiple base classes. In the case of multiple inheritance, attribute search follows a depth-first, left-to-right order, and a dynamic algorithm called method resolution order is used to determine the order in which base classes are searched.

Derived classes can override methods of their base classes by defining a method with the same name. The overridden method can be called using the syntax `BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments)`. Python provides the `isinstance()` function to check the type of an instance and the `issubclass()` function to check class inheritance relationships.

Overall, inheritance in Python allows for code reuse, extensibility, and the creation of complex class hierarchies by building upon existing classes.
