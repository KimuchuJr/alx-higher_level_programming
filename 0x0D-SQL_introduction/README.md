SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a domain-specific programming language designed for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL is used for a wide range of tasks related to database management, including data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion, as well as defining and managing database schemas and structures.

Key features and aspects of SQL include:

1. **Data Querying:** SQL allows users to query databases to retrieve specific data based on specified criteria. The most commonly used SQL command for data retrieval is the `SELECT` statement.

2. **Data Modification:** SQL provides commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` to add, modify, or remove data from a database.

3. **Schema Definition:** SQL is used to define the structure of a database, including the creation of tables, specifying data types, setting constraints, and establishing relationships between tables.

4. **Data Integrity:** SQL supports data integrity constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints, to maintain the consistency and integrity of data.

5. **Transaction Management:** SQL supports transactions, which allow a series of database operations to be treated as a single unit. Transactions ensure that data changes are made atomically (all or nothing) and maintain the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

6. **User Access Control:** SQL includes commands for managing user accounts, permissions, and security, allowing administrators to control who can access and manipulate the database.

SQL is a standardized language, and the SQL standard has evolved over the years. Different database management systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and others, implement SQL to varying degrees of compliance with the standard. While there are some variations and extensions among these systems, the core SQL syntax and concepts remain largely consistent.

SQL is a fundamental tool for working with relational databases and is widely used by database administrators, developers, data analysts, and data scientists to interact with and manage data stored in databases.
