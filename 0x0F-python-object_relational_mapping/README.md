Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique used in Python to bridge the gap between the object-oriented world of Python and the relational world of databases. ORM frameworks provide a way to interact with a database using Python classes and objects, making it easier to work with databases without writing raw SQL queries.

One of the most popular ORM frameworks in Python is SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy allows you to define Python classes that represent database tables, and it provides a high-level API for querying and manipulating the database.

Here's a basic example of how SQLAlchemy ORM works:

1. Install SQLAlchemy:

   You can install SQLAlchemy using pip:

   ```
   pip install sqlalchemy
   ```

2. Define a Python class that maps to a database table:

   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, create_engine
   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

   Base = declarative_base()

   class User(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'users'

       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
       username = Column(String)
       email = Column(String)

   ```

3. Create a database connection and session:

   ```python
   engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')  # Replace with your database URL
   Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
   session = Session()
   ```

4. Create database tables:

   ```python
   Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
   ```

5. Insert data into the database:

   ```python
   new_user = User(username='john_doe', email='john@example.com')
   session.add(new_user)
   session.commit()
   ```

6. Query data from the database:

   ```python
   user = session.query(User).filter_by(username='john_doe').first()
   print(user.username, user.email)
   ```

7. Update and delete data as needed:

   ```python
   user.username = 'new_username'
   session.commit()

   session.delete(user)
   session.commit()
   ```

SQLAlchemy provides a powerful and flexible way to work with databases in Python while abstracting away many of the low-level details of SQL. It supports various database backends, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more, making it a versatile choice for ORM in Python. Other ORM frameworks for Python include Django ORM (built into the Django web framework) and Peewee, each with its own set of features and strengths.
